##Bash 

------
As the major application I'm using on a daily basis, I guess *Bash* deserves a separated section to be talked about. 

### What is Bash<sup>1</sup>?
Essentially, *Bash* is a command-line interface shell (CLI shell), contrary to a graphical user interface (GUI).  Alternatively speaking, by typing in commands on Bash, one can manipulate files and settings on the computers without touching your mouse; as for a GUI programme, a mouse is necessary to achieve any goal. 

### Why should I use it ? 
Needless to say, there are several operating systems out there, and every of them constructs utterly different GUI guideline for their platforms, which means different user experience. 

For Bash, or any CLI in general, the basic language is exact same across different platforms. Once you learnt it, it's done, lifetime, guaranteed. 

### Is it perfect ? 
Of course not. CLI programme can be considered as a replacement of Finder in OS X or Folder in Windows (with more other utilities). For any type of file other than .txt, we can only edit them through other correct softwares. 

But it is elegant, efficient, and consistent. 
### Applications on OS X<sup>2</sup>
##### Terminal 
The stack application. 
##### iTerm
The one I'm currently using, non-complains.
